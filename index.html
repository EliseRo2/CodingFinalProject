        <p class="information">The cost of prescription medications is a large part of the American Healthcare system. Companies across the world manufacture and sell some of the most commonly prescribed medications used to treat health conditions.</p>
        
        <p class="information">However, the true cost of prescription medications can be a complicated topic to understand. The wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of a prescription medication is defined as the list price set by pharmaceutical manufacturers. It is mainly for wholesalers and other direct purchasers. The wholesale acquisition cost of a particular medication can vary by state.</p>
